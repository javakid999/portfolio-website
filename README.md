known bugs:
- spin animation not really working on my fav card
- spotlight animation is broken in other resolutions
- blinkies teleport in because css animations are dogshit
- windows can spawn partially outside of the page
- if you bounce the windows against the wall you can trigger more than one render animation loop and it goes hypersonic
